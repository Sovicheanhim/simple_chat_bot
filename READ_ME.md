Greeting! In this repository, there'll be a simple chatbot program that will automatically replies to messages from Messenger.
This is a very basic program yet cool enough to show off your friends about your chatbot by using Python and Dialogflow.

*Modules you need to install are:*
1. fbchat
2. apiai
3. codecs
4. json
<b>(*The last two modules are already installed when you download Python)</b>

However, in this program, I've created another module named "credentials".
It's a simple module, just to store my username and password, so that you can't see it from the original code.

Anyway have fun with it! Good luck!
